  <h4>We all have hobbies that we love to do in our spare time, whether it is writing, singing, gaming or even crocheting. These activities make a person unique and bring happiness to their lives; these are my hobbies:-</h4><br><br>

 <p>Baking is one of my favorite hobbies because I get to experiment with different flavors, and try extraordinary
  combinations, to get a unique and delicious dish that I have never tried before. Like when I made a burnt basque cheese
  cake with lemons and drizzled nutella on top.</p>

  <p>Coding is also one of my best activities because I get to learn how to create amazing apps and websites like this one. I have been learning how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript languages and I hope I can master them along with python and Java. I have spent weeks learning this essential skill so I have improved a lot and I hope to get even better.</p></div>

    <p>I have always been in love with swimming, whether it was at the beach or a swimming pool. I love moving around in the water, diving and doing cool tricks like flips. My father first taught me this essential skill when I was 12 and I have been improving ever since. Although this sport is crucial to know, I can not practice it often since it gets cold in the winter. </p>
